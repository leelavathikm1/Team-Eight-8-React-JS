    <p style="color: maroon;"><span style="color: black;"> A computer is a Digital Electronic Machine</span> that can be
            programmed to carry out sequences of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">'arithmetic or logical operations'</span> (computation) automatically. Modern
            computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to
            perform a wide range of tasks.
    </p>
    <p style="background-color: gray;"> A computer system is a "complete" computer that includes the hardware, operating
        system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for "full" operation. This term may also refer
        to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.
